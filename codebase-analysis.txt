6. **Detail Page (app/[planetId].tsx)**
   - Dynamic route accepting celestial body ID
   - Comprehensive information display
   - Organized data presentation with alternating row colors
   - Sections for atmosphere composition and temperature data
   - Scrollable content with custom styling

DATA STRUCTURE & CONTENT
=========================

The app contains detailed information for:

**Planets (8 total):**
- Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune
- Each with: mass, radius, distance from sun, orbital data, temperature, 
  gravity, discovery info, composition, magnetic field strength

**Stars (2 samples):**
- Betelgeuse and Sirius
- Data includes: spectral type, distance, magnitude, radius, temperature, 
  mass, luminosity, age

**Messier Objects (2 samples):**
- Andromeda Galaxy (M31) and Orion Nebula (M42)
- Information includes: catalog numbers, object types, distances, 
  visibility data, composition

STYLING & DESIGN

CURRENT LIMITATIONS & OBSERVATIONS
===================================

**Incomplete Features:**
1. Search functionality (UI present, no backend implementation)
2. Virtual/AR section (minimal placeholder content)
3. User profile persistence (hardcoded placeholder data)
4. Image management (mostly placeholder images, some broken references)

**Data Issues:**
1. Some planets use placeholder image instead of specific planet images
2. Limited star and messier object samples (2 each)
3. Inconsistent image naming and organization

**Code Quality Observations:**
1. Well-structured component architecture
2. Proper TypeScript interfaces and types
3. Consistent naming conventions
4. Good separation of concerns
5. Some unused imports and commented code blocks

POTENTIAL ENHANCEMENTS
======================
1. **Complete Search Implementation**: Add search functionality with filtering
2. **Data Expansion**: Add more stars, messier objects, and exoplanets
3. **Image Optimization**: Replace placeholders with proper celestial images
4. **Virtual Reality Features**: Implement AR/VR viewing capabilities
5. **User Authentication**: Add proper user management and data persistence
6. **Offline Support**: Cache data for offline viewing
7. **Favorites System**: Allow users to bookmark celestial bodies
8. **Interactive Features**: Add quizzes, comparisons, and educational games
9. **Push Notifications**: Daily space facts or celestial events
10. **Social Features**: Share discoveries and learning progress

TECHNICAL DEBT
===============
1. Placeholder data in profile section needs proper implementation
2. Image asset organization could be improved
3. Some components could be further modularized
4. Error handling could be enhanced
5. Loading states not implemented for data fetching

DEPLOYMENT READINESS
====================
The app appears ready for development/testing deployment but would need:
1. Proper image assets
2. Backend integration for user data
3. Search functionality implementation
4. Content expansion
5. Testing on all target platforms

CONCLUSION
==========
SpaceCrafts is a well-architected educational astronomy app with solid technical 
foundations. The React Native/Expo setup with TypeScript provides excellent 
development experience and cross-platform compatibility. The app demonstrates 
good coding practices and has a clear, intuitive user interface design.

The core functionality for browsing and learning about celestial bodies is 
well-implemented, with room for expansion in terms of content, features, and 
user engagement. The modular component structure makes it easy to add new 
features and maintain the codebase.

The app has strong potential as an educational tool and could serve as an 
excellent foundation for a comprehensive astronomy learning platform.
